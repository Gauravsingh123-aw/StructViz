StructViz is a developer-first tool that visualizes JavaScript and TypeScript code structure by parsing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). It transforms complex codebases into intuitive, navigable graphs â€” helping engineers understand architecture, trace logic, and debug faster. Whether you're onboarding to a new project or refactoring legacy code, StructViz reveals the hidden structure behind the syntax.
